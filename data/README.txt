The required input data includes the gene expression matrix file, spatial file, and the pattern cell IDs file, which you have selected based on the TrimNN method.

For illustration, we use the 13-month-old Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse control replicate 2 sample.

In this example, the pattern is a size-4 CCCM. Each row represents a group of 4 cells forming one CCCM.
